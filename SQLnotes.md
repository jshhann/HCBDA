### SQL Joins

**Inner Join:**
- Returns rows when there is at least one match with table name.
- Avoid Ambiguity by qualifying each column name with table name.
- Join tables based on relationships as well as ad-hoc(created for a particular purpose as necessary).
- Common Operators for Join =, >, <, <=, >=.
