- Spaces between your markdown code 

# Horizontal Break
To create a horizontal rule, use three or more asterisks (***), dashes (---), or underscores (___) on a line by themselves.
Must have blank lines before and after horizonal rule.

# Code Blocks

To create code blocks, indent every line of the block by at least four spaces or one tab.

    <html>
      <head>
      </head>
    </html>

# Lists
<br>
If you need to start an unordered list item with a number followed by a period, you can use a backslash (\) to escape the period.

|Type|Code|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Ordered List|1. txt|1.<BR>2.|
|Bullet List| - |- <br> -|
|Bullet List with Number as Txt|'- 1993\.'|- 1993\.|

|---|---|---|
|Blockquote|  > | 
|Nested Blockquote| >>|
